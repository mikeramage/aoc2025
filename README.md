# Advent of Code 2025

Here we Go again again.

3 days late to the party. Why do I do this year on year?

## Day 1
This was painful. Like a slug on ketamine I slithered slowly towards a solution, only dimly aware of my surroundings, straining to comprehend the world through a fuzzy cloud of confusion and doubt. There's clever and then there's my code. There's fast and then there's my coding. 

Dreary.

## Day 2
Rancid.

## Day 3
That was actually more or less painless. My eyelids were drooping and my eyeballs were crossing uncontrollably and rolling up inside them for some reason, so the screen wasn't in focus for much of the time. But somehow that doesn't seem to have affected my performance. I'll take it.
